		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
		This is an example file server.<br><br>

		<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
		This server was made with node.js! As a science project (in class), I used 
		node.js with Express to make a HTTP server that could
		serve static files. This worked out great! It has 404 pages, an index page, 
		and can serve arbitrary files (even in directories!). It can't serve the directories properly, though,
		so I made a check to see if it's a directory. If it is, 404!

		<h2>Example links:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/non/existent.txt">Non existent page</a></li>
			<li><a href="/example.html">Example page</a></li>
			<li><a href="/style.css">The style of this page</a></li>
		</ul>
